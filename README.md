# ANNOptimization
## Binary Classification
## Data Preprocessing
using one of csv files loaded with this repository (consider only binary classification), scan the data and describe it 
(numbers of parameters, target, balanced or not, missing data)

## ANN Model 
propose the ANN Model to do classification, display differents metrics and ROC, then evaluate your model learning

## Optimisation 
using different techniques of optimization try to improve your models: test most than 3 techniques
